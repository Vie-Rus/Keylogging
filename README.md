# Keylogging
    Current Version 1.5

    This keylogging Python program will track your computer's keyboard strokes and certain special keys and commands and record them in a text file (v1.5). 
    Certain special keys and commands will be listed down below.

    Since this is simply a keyboarding tracking program, all systems can detect when you can run this program to prevent malicious intent.
